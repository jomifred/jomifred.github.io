 <H1>Social problems in agent migration</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>The main problem that a society must solve when an agent enters or leaves is how to maintain its functional integrity (Rocha Costa, 94)
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>After an agent migrates, the society must insure that it continues to function as well as (or better than) it did before the migration. The society left behind must be able to find among its remaining agents some that can assume responsibility for the function of the agent that left
<LI>The society the agent enters must be able to find ways to appropriately place the agent within its existing social structure and must also be able to modify that social structure, to enable the agent to perform its required functions.
