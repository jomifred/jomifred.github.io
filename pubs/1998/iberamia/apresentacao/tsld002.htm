<LI><H2>In a multi-agent system, the agents need to cooperate in order to achieve common goals
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Co-operation implies having knowledge about others (their skills, desires, plans, etc), in such a way that one agent can request some task of another. Some of this information may be inferred from the social role the agent plays
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>For example: in a society of producers and consumers
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The agents’ roles are: producers and consumers
<LI>From these roles, we can infer that an agent who is a producer has producing skills, wants to sell products, has a producer timetable, and so on
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Knowing the roles of others is thus useful in both interaction and co-operation</H2>
