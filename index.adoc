* Programming languages for autonomous agents

== Projects

=== http://jacamo.sf.net[*JaCaMo*]
Multi-Agent Programming Framework

[verse]
http://jacamo.sf.net[JaCaMo] is a framework for Multi-Agent Programming that combines three separate technologies (Jason, Cartago, and Moise), each of them being well-known on its own and developed for a number of years so they are fairly robust and fully-fledged.

=== http://jason.sf.net[*Jason*]
Programming BDI agents with AgentSpeak

[verse]
Developed in a collaboration with http://www.inf.pucrs.br/r.bordini/Rafael_Bordini/Welcome.html[Rafael Bordini] (PUCRS, Brazil) and Jomi Hübner (University of Santa Catarina, Brazil). The project develops an interpreter and platform for an agent-oriented programming language called http://jason.sf.net[Jason].

Organisational model and Normative Programming Language

[verse]
Developed in a collaboration of ENS Mines of Saint Etienne (France), University of São Paulo (Brazil), and University of Santa Catarina (Brazil). The objective is to develop an organisational model that allows the programming of several dimensions of the organisation of a multi-agent system, e.g., structure, functioning, norms, and context.

//=== ForTrust
//Reputation and trust model for MAS -- _finished_

//[verse]
//Developed by Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (France), ENS Mines of Saint Etienne (France), and Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (Italy). The objective is to formalise and implement the reputation model proposed by Castelfranchi et al. in the context of security systems.
